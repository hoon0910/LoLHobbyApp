üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & library

Minimum Requirements

Minimum SDK: 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat)

Language: Kotlin

Architecture

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):
Separates UI, business logic, and data layers for better maintainability and testability.

Repository Pattern:
Acts as a mediator between data sources (local DB, network, etc.) and business logic, ensuring consistent data management.

Core Libraries

Jetpack Compose
Android‚Äôs modern declarative UI toolkit for building native interfaces with less code.

(androidx.compose.*, material3, foundation, ui, animation, tooling.preview, material.icons.extended, constraintlayout.compose)

Lifecycle
Observes Android component lifecycles and manages UI state accordingly.
(androidx.lifecycle.*)

ViewModel
Stores and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, surviving configuration changes.
(androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.*)

Navigation Compose
Simplifies navigation and deep linking between composables in Jetpack Compose.
(androidx.navigation.compose)

Room

Provides a type-safe abstraction layer over SQLite for local database access.
(androidx.room.*)

Hilt

Standardizes dependency injection, automating object creation and improving testability.
(hilt, hilt.android, androidx.hilt.navigation.compose, kapt(hilt.compiler))
