## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Library

### Minimum Requirements
- **Minimum SDK:** 24 (Android 7.0 Nougat)  
- **Language:** Kotlin  

### Architecture
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** Separates UI, business logic, and data layers for better maintainability and testability.  
- **Repository Pattern:** Acts as a mediator between data sources (local DB, network, etc.) and business logic, ensuring consistent data management.  

### Core Libraries
- **Jetpack Compose** ‚Äì Android‚Äôs modern declarative UI toolkit  
  (`androidx.compose.*, material3, foundation, ui, animation, tooling.preview, material.icons.extended, constraintlayout.compose`)  
- **Lifecycle** ‚Äì Observes Android component lifecycles and manages UI state (`androidx.lifecycle.*`)  
- **ViewModel** ‚Äì Stores and manages UI-related data across configuration changes (`androidx.lifecycle.viewmodel.*`)  
- **Navigation Compose** ‚Äì Simplifies navigation and deep linking (`androidx.navigation.compose`)  
- **Room** ‚Äì Type-safe abstraction layer over SQLite (`androidx.room.*`)  
- **Hilt** ‚Äì Dependency injection framework (`hilt, hilt.android, androidx.hilt.navigation.compose, kapt(hilt.compiler)`)  
- **Retrofit2** ‚Äì Type-safe HTTP client (`retrofit, converter.gson`)  
- **OkHttp3** ‚Äì HTTP client for network communication (`okhttp`)  
- **Gson** ‚Äì JSON serialization/deserialization (`gson`)  
- **Coil** ‚Äì Image loading library optimized for Compose (`coil.compose`)  
- **Coroutines & Flow** ‚Äì Async programming and reactive data (`androidx.lifecycle.runtime.ktx, androidx.room.ktx`)  
- **ConstraintLayout Compose** ‚Äì Flexible UI layouts (`androidx.constraintlayout.compose`)  

### Open-Source Libraries Used
- Jetpack Compose  
- AndroidX Lifecycle  
- AndroidX Navigation Compose  
- Room  
- Hilt  
- Retrofit2  
- OkHttp3  
- Gson  
- Coil  
- ConstraintLayout Compose
